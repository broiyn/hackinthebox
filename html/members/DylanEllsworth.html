      <p class="text">
        Hi, My name is Dylan! I am a third year student at UCSD studying computer science and business.
        In my free time I like to surf, hike, and travel. My favorite sports are football and baseball.
        Because my parents are from California and Minesota, I grew up watching teams from both states.
        Now I root for the Vikings and Chargers for football and the Padres and Twins in  baseball. I 
        travel and camp relatively often, however this last year I was limited with the pandemic. Hopefully
        now that people are getting vaccinated and we build up immunity, we  can go back to doing the activities 
        that we enjoy and  interacting  with each other in person!
      </p>

        I love nature and enjoy traveling to new places around the country. I like to bring a camera with me
        wherever I go to document my adventures. One day I hope to  visit all  50 states! Here are a few pictures 
        from my some of my most recent trips:
